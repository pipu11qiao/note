Put on your war paint
画上你的战妆
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
你虽如巨石加身将我拽入深渊
Strike a match and i'll burn you to the ground
但我会划亮火柴将你烧至乌有
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
我们是出现在7月的南瓜灯
Setting fire to the sky
恣意燃烧划破天际
Here, here comes this rising tide
而如今潮涨来袭危机四起
So come on
吾辈尽将奔赴战场英勇杀敌

Put on your war paint
披上你的戎装吧
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to dies
吾愿背负十字，默默祈祷，战死沙场
Sliver clouds with grey linings
而我已经看见乌云背后胜利的曙光
So we can take the world back from a heart attack
我们终将从失落暴戾手中夺回城池
One maniac at a time we will take back
甚至一个狂躁的战士就够了
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
你也知道当你在等待战歌响起之时时间也在匆匆流逝
So dance alone to the beat of you heart
所以独自随心舞动吧
Hey!young blood!
嘿！年轻人！
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out ?
你难道感受不到时光飞逝所剩无几？
I'm gonna change you like a remix
我一定会像混音一样天翻地覆地改造你
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
接着你便会如凤凰涅磐般崛起
Wearing our vintage misery
我们都带着曾经的苦难忧伤
No, I think it looked a little better on me
不，我觉得我伤的更深懂得愈多
I'm gonna change you like a remix
我一定会像混音一样天翻地覆地改造你
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
接着你便会如凤凰涅磐般崛起

Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks
带上那些战争中的热血少年和坦克碎片回家吧
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
结个婚，然后说不定以抢银行度过余生
Because the world is just a teller and we wearing black
因为世间只讲述历史而我们只是活在黑暗笼罩下的普通人
You broke out spirits says the note we pass
而我们正戴着黑色的面具

So we can take the world back from a heart attack
我们终将从失落暴戾手中夺回城池
One maniac at a time we will take back
甚至一个狂躁的战士就够了
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
你知道当你在等一首歌播放的时候时间已经一直在迫近
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
所以别等了就跟随著你心里的拍子起舞吧!
